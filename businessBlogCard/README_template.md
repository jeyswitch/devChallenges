<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

### What I learned

I learnt more concepts concerning Flexbox, including when to use and implement the position attribute. This project also taught me patience, in the sense that when developing a site, learn to think and pause. Good Coding doesn't neccessarily mean coding fast or quick, its all about problem-solving.  

I really feel, my CSS knowledge is improving. Still getting the hang of responsiveness but it will be clear to me in due time.

### Useful resources

I did not actually use any resources as it was quite a simple Blog card. Although I had a little help from ChatGPT, apart from that most of it were derived by my humble self.

### Built with

<!-- Technologies/Tools used in this project are as follows;-->

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

## Features

I did not use the figma file as I have not subscribed to the PRO version and I don't plan on doing so.

This application/site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

## Acknowledgements
 I downloaded the Color picker extension on Chrome, a very helpful tool that enables you select and choose any color from any website at all.
 With this tool you can use a color of interest from another site and implement in yours.
